simulated annealing pseudocode

C = C init
for T = Tmax to Tmin
	E_c = E(c) (energy, what we want to maximize)
	N = next(c)
	E_N = E(N)
	delta E = E_N - E_C
	if (delta E > 0) (it is a good move)
		C = N
	elif (exp(delta E / T) > rand(0,1))
		not a good move, but maybe good to explore in the long run
		C = N
